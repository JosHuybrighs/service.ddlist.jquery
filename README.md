##service.ddlist.jquery - Styleable dropdown list

###Description

service.ddlist.jquery is a small jQuery plugin that allows for a fully styleable dropdown list supporting list options with text, images, and possible additional description strings.

The list is expected to be defined using a standard `<select>` element, which will be hidden by the plugin. The list is then 'reconstructed' by means of a jquery-generated `<div>` container.

Although the `<select>` will be hidden full support is provided to submit the correct "selected" option to the server when the list is part of a form.

This dropdown list is of course not to be confused with a dropdown menu.
