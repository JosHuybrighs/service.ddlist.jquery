##service.ddlist.jquery - Styleable dropdown list

###Description

service.ddlist.jquery is a small jQuery plugin that allows for a fully styleable dropdown list supporting list options with text, images, and possible additional description strings.

The list can be constructed in 2 ways:

- By using a standard `<select>` element with one or more `<option>` items, which will be hidden by the plugin. The list is then 'reconstructed' by means of a jquery-generated `<div>` container.
- By passing a JSON object (an array) where each entry contains a list item defined through a set of properties (key/value).  

In case of the `<select><option>` approach full support is provided to submit the correct "selected" option to the server when the list is part of a form.

This dropdown list is of course not to be confused with a dropdown menu.
